    <string name="introduction">Welcome to 25 Gestures!
	    This game has 25 stages. In each one, you will be prompted with a direction (either left, right, up, down, or \'click\'). Left, right, up and down are shown with an arrow pointing in their respective directions. When you see the arrow, move you hand over the  camera in that direction. A prompt for a click gesture is shown as a large white circle. To click, cover the camera with your hand for 1 to 2 seconds. When the camera detects an accurate gesture, you\'ll automatically move onto the next round! </string>
